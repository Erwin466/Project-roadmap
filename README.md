# Project Roadmap Frontend

A modern, modular learning platform frontend with deep integration to a Django backend. The platform now features full API integration, gamification, shop, social, and dashboard modules, all built with accessibility, performance, security, and developer experience in mind.

---

## üöÄ Features

- **Authentication:** JWT, OAuth2 (Google, GitHub), secure session management, CSRF protection, password reset, email verification, robust error handling, and TypeScript definitions.
- **Gamification:** Points, badges, leaderboards, streaks, quests, achievement notifications, real-time updates, and backend-synced progress.
- **Shop:** Categories, featured items, purchases with points, badge/level unlocks, user inventory, purchase history, shopping cart, and gamification integration.
- **Social:** Activity feed, comments, likes, shares, discussions, following/followers, referral system, forums, notifications, and embeddable components.
- **Dashboard:** Personalized learning progress, gamification stats, recent activity, recommended courses, quick access widgets, and social/gamification widgets.
- **Courses:** Dynamic course/lesson loading, enrollments, progress sync, completion tracking, recommendations, and backend-driven content.
- **Accessibility:** ARIA, keyboard navigation, focus indicators, screen reader support, semantic HTML, and skip navigation.
- **Performance:** ES6+ modules, code splitting, intersection observer, optimized animations, debounced API calls, and responsive design.
- **Testing & CI:** Unit/integration/E2E tests, GitHub Actions, linting, security scanning, automated deployment, and test utilities.
- **Documentation:** Architecture, API integration, troubleshooting, contribution guidelines, onboarding, and API usage examples.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The frontend is structured for scalability, maintainability, and modern best practices:

- **Pages (`Page/`):** HTML entry points for main, dashboard, shop, social, roadmaps, signin, signup, etc.
- **Scripts (`Script/`):** Modular ES6+ JavaScript for each feature (auth, gamification, shop, social, utils, components).
- **Styles (`Style/`):** Modular CSS, custom properties, responsive design, utility classes, feature-specific styles.
- **Config (`Config/`):** Auth SDK, API base config, type definitions.
- **Tests (`tests/`):** Unit, integration, and E2E tests for all modules.
- **Docs (`docs/`):** Architecture, API, troubleshooting, and contribution docs.
- **CI/CD (`.github/`):** Workflows for linting, testing, deployment, PR/issue templates, dependabot.
- **Build (`webpack.config.js`):** Webpack for bundling, dev server, hot reload, asset optimization.
- **Utilities (`Script/utils.js`):** Shared helpers for validation, formatting, accessibility, and performance.
- **Components (`Script/components.js`):** Reusable UI components for modals, notifications, progress bars, etc.

### Data Flow

- **API Integration:** All data flows through `/api/v1/` endpoints. AuthSDK manages tokens, CSRF, and error handling. All modules use `apiRequest` for backend communication.
- **State Management:** Stateless, with session/localStorage for tokens. Real-time updates via polling or WebSocket (future).
- **Component System:** Reusable UI components (modals, notifications, progress bars, cards, buttons) in `Script/components.js`.
- **Accessibility:** All interactive elements are keyboard and screen reader accessible.

### Main Modules

- **Auth:** Handles login, signup, OAuth2, password reset, email verification, token refresh, and error handling.
- **Gamification:** Loads and displays user points, badges, leaderboards, streaks, quests, and achievement notifications. Integrates with all user actions.
- **Shop:** Dynamic shop with categories, featured items, purchases, inventory, and cart. Points and badge integration for unlocks.
- **Social:** Activity feed, comments, likes, shares, following/followers, forums, and notifications. Modular for embedding in any page.
- **Dashboard:** Personalized hub with widgets for progress, stats, activity, recommendations, and quick links.
- **Courses:** Dynamic course/lesson loading, enrollments, progress sync, completion tracking, and recommendations.
- **Utils/Components:** Shared utilities for validation, sanitization, formatting, notifications, and UI components.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Technology Stack

- **Languages:** HTML5, CSS3 (modular, responsive, custom properties), JavaScript (ES6+ modules, async/await)
- **Build Tools:** Webpack, Babel, ESLint, Prettier
- **Testing:** Jest (unit/integration/E2E), test utilities, DOM mocking
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions (lint, test, deploy), Dependabot
- **Accessibility:** ARIA, semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, screen reader support

## ‚ö° Setup

1. **Clone the repo**
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run dev` (start development server with hot reload)
4. `npm run build` (production build)
5. Configure backend API URL if needed in `Config/auth-sdk.js`
